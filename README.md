[00:32.21] She wakes up early every morning
[00:34.77] Just to do her hair, now
[00:37.23] Because she cares, y'all
[00:40.27] Her day, oh, wouldn't be right
[00:42.83] Without her make up
[00:45.45] She's never out of make up
[00:58.45] 
[00:48.36] She's just like you and me
[00:50.89] But she's homeless, she's homeless
[00:56.17] As she stands there
[00:58.27] Singing for money
[01:06.77] 
[00:59.37] "La-da-dee, la-di-da
[01:03.07] La-da-dee, la-di-da"
[01:13.07] 
[01:36.42] You try hard not to care
[01:38.31] While I'm so homeless
[01:38.65] 'Cause you got your own mess
[01:39.24] You barely make enough for you
[01:39.88] Well is she online?
[01:40.15] Could you apologise?
[01:40.80] A little small slab of cheese
[01:41.42] And she stands there singin' for money
[02:00.42] 
[01:42.19] "La-da-dee, la-di-da
[01:43.53] La-da-dee, la-di-da"
[01:53.53] 
[01:43.88] In my sleep I see her begging
[01:44.56] Preaching, "Please"
[01:46.74] Although her body's not mine
[01:48.27] I ask God, "Why, God why?"
[02:01.27] 
[01:51.97] She's just like you and me
[01:54.85] But she's homeless, she's homeless
[02:00.17] As she stands there
[02:01.86] Singing for money
[02:10.36] 
[02:03.76] "La-da-dee, la-di-da
[02:19.47] La-da-dee, la-di-da"
[02:29.47] 
[02:56.52] She wakes up early every morning
[02:57.99] Just to do her hair, now
[02:58.63] Because she cares, y'all
[02:58.96] Her day, oh, wouldn't be right
[02:59.54] Without her make up
[03:00.19] She's never out of make up
[03:13.19] 
[03:00.53] She's just like you and me
[03:00.92] But she's homeless, she's homeless
[03:03.74] She's homeless, she's homeless
[03:07.41] She's homeless
[03:14.41] 
[03:08.18] She's just like you and me
[03:09.28] As she stands there
[03:09.93] Singing for money
[03:18.43] 
[03:10.94] "La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:12.32] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:13.32] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:15.20] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:16.21] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:17.54] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:19.07] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:20.46] La-da-dee, la-di-da"
[03:30.46] 
[03:23.82] "La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:25.63] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:27.09] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:28.19] La-da-dee, la-di-da"
[03:38.19] 
[03:36.81] "La-da-dee, la-di-da
[03:45.94] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[04:16.27] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[04:17.56] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[04:19.60] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[04:21.53] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[04:23.39] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[04:25.68] La-da-dee, la-di-da"
[04:35.68] 
[05:36.36] "La-da-dee, la-di-da
[05:38.04] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[05:40.34] La-da-dee, la-di-da
[05:43.65] La-da-dee, la-di-da..."
